# Reproducibility Repository for: A Path-based Approach to Analyzing the Global Liner Shipping Network

This repository will contain code for the methods and analyses described in the following paper:

* LaRock, T., Xu, M., Eliassi-Rad, T. A Path-based Approach to Analyzing the Global Liner Shipping Network. arXiv:2110.11925 [physics.soc-ph], October 2021. [arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11925). To appear in EPJ Data Science, Spring 2022.

The data used for our analyses are proprietary and provided by [Alphaliner](https://public.alphaliner.com/). Per the agreement under which the data were provided, we are not able to share the shipping routes themselves. Instead, we will develop and release a realistic set of synthetic routes that show similar characteristics to demonstrate our methodology. We will also release route betweenness values for ports and edges calculated using the real dataset. Although unfortunately this means the work will not be fully reproducible, we will be able to demonstrate some of the most important results of our research, and prototype code for our minimum-route path computations will be available free and open source.

As of late March 2022, this repository is a work in progress. We anticipate a more complete repository becoming available by the summer of 2022. If you have any questions about the work at any point, do not hesitate to contact Timothy LaRock [via email](mailto:timothylarock@gmail.com).
